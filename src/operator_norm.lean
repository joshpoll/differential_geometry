  The operator norm is the natural norm for linear operators between normed vector spaces. One can think of it as how much a map stretches unit vectors or as the smallest value that guarantees Cauchy-Schwarz (i.e. ∥L v∥ ≤ ∥L∥ * ∥v∥).

  The derivative of f : E → F is f' : E → continuous_linear_map E F.

  We need the operator norm both to define continuity for the Caratheodory derivative and to take higher-order derivatives.
